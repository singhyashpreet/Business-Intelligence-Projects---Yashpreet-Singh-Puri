# PowerBI Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a PowerBI dashboard for AceBikes, a fictional bikes and biking accessories retailer. The data was extracted from multiple '.csv' and '.xlsx' data files. This project involved building Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) using the Balanced Scorecard approach. This project required a comprehensive understanding of the company's objectives and performance metrics, as well as the ability to translate them into meaningful KPIs and KRIs to monitor performance and mitigate risks effectively. The `.pbix` file can be downloaded and opened in PowerBI Desktop.
